#### Create a form for an event registration desk.

Let's imagine that there is a registration desk for the event.
People can come in groups or individually.

Take an input: Number of people in the group

On left half screen(top on mobile), show a form for each person in the group.

On right half screen, show preview of the form.

In preview participants should be sorted by their age in ascending order.
